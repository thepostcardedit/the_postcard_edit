<h1>About The Postcard Edit</h1>

<p><strong>The Postcard Edit</strong> began in <strong>2013</strong> as a visual project centered around documenting the beauty in everyday life. The quiet, the ordinary, the seemingly mundane. Over time, it became a recognisable micro-brand with a distinct aesthetic that focuses on simplicity, stillness, and emotional detail.</p>

<p>This website exists to clarify authorship and originality. The Postcard Edit is the <strong>original creator and originator of the name</strong>. Any accounts, profiles, or businesses using the same name were created at a later date.</p>

<h2>What I Do</h2>
<p>"Pretty pictures of the mundane" but deeper than that, I capture small moments with emotional weight. A personal lens on stillness, repetition, memory, and beauty hiding in plain sight.</p>
